# Sample Model and Student Answers

## Example 1: Artificial Intelligence

Model answer:
Artificial intelligence uses algorithms and data to enable machines to learn, make decisions, and solve problems.

Student answer:
AI lets computers learn from data and use algorithms to make decisions and solve tasks.

## Example 2: Cloud Computing

Model answer:
Cloud computing provides scalable computing resources over the internet, reducing infrastructure costs and improving flexibility.

Student answer:
Using the cloud means you can scale resources online, save money on hardware, and stay flexible.

## Example 3: Databases

Model answer:
A relational database stores data in tables with rows and columns, and uses SQL to query and manage relationships.

Student answer:
Relational databases organize information in tables and you use SQL to retrieve data and link related records.

## Example 4: Networking

Model answer:
A router forwards data packets between different networks, while a switch connects devices within the same local network.

Student answer:
Routers move packets across networks, and switches connect devices on the same LAN.

## Example 5: Operating Systems

Model answer:
An operating system manages hardware resources, runs applications, and provides services such as memory and process management.

Student answer:
The OS controls hardware, runs programs, and handles memory and process control services.

## Example 6: Machine Learning

Model answer:
Supervised learning trains a model on labeled data to predict outputs for new inputs.

Student answer:
In supervised learning, you use labeled examples to teach a model to predict results for new data.

## Example 7: Software Engineering

Model answer:
Unit testing checks individual components in isolation to ensure they behave correctly.

Student answer:
Unit tests validate small pieces of code by testing each part separately.

## Example 8: Cybersecurity

Model answer:
Encryption converts plaintext into ciphertext to protect data confidentiality during storage or transmission.

Student answer:
Encrypting data turns it into unreadable text so it stays private while stored or sent.

## Example 9: Data Structures

Model answer:
A stack is a LIFO data structure where the last element added is the first removed.

Student answer:
Stacks follow last-in-first-out order: the most recent item is removed first.

## Example 10: Computer Architecture

Model answer:
The CPU performs instruction execution, arithmetic operations, and controls other system components.

Student answer:
The processor executes instructions, does calculations, and coordinates other parts of the computer.
